Sub::Attempt - Attempt to execute a block N times before forwarding an exception

This module exports a single function called attempt, which tries to execute
a subroutine N times before throwing the exception.  Optionally, an error
handler may be provided to take any specialized action with the error after
each attempt.  The primary inspiration was to add reliability to code when
interfacing with inherently unreliable processes.  See the example below.
